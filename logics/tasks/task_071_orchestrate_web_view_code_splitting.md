# Context
- Orchestrate the scaffolded request chain and keep sibling implementation slices linked.

# Plan
- [ ] 1. Run a production build and record the current chunk sizes.
- [ ] 2. Identify the App.tsx switch points that mount garage, championship, report, and replay surfaces.
- [ ] 3. Wrap the selected views in React.lazy/Suspense with one existing-style fallback.
- [ ] 4. Run build and compare chunk output against the baseline.
- [ ] 5. Run typecheck, lint, unit tests, and private-league e2e; record validation evidence in closeout.
- [ ] ADR 009 checkpoint: update affected Logics docs during each meaningful wave and leave the repo commit-ready.
- [ ] Keep commit creation under operator control; do not force one commit per micro-step.
- [ ] GATE: do not close until lint, audit, and scaffold validation pass.

# Backlog
- `item_168_lazy_load_secondary_web_views`

# Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] Generated request, product, backlog, and task docs are present.
- [ ] Context-pack handoff is available when requested.
- [ ] Validation passes.
- [ ] Meaningful waves followed ADR 009: affected docs updated and the repo left commit-ready without automatic commits.

# AC Traceability
- request-AC1 -> This task. Proof: scaffold command generated the request-chain corpus.
- request-AC4 -> This task. Proof: optional context-pack handoff is supported.
- request-AC6 -> This task. Proof: dry-run and collision checks bound file changes.
- request-AC8 -> This task. Proof: CLI help documents the one-pass scaffold workflow.

# Validation
- Run `python3 -m logics_manager lint --require-status`.
- Run scaffold command tests.

# Report
- Implementation complete.
