# Context
- Orchestrate the scaffolded request chain and keep sibling implementation slices linked.

# Plan
- [ ] 1. Inspect report/result derivations and identify existing data available for non-winning feedback.
- [ ] 2. Implement a pure verdict derivation helper with positive and negative tests.
- [ ] 3. Render feedback in existing result/report surfaces with compact copy.
- [ ] 4. Add EN/FR i18n keys and targeted render/e2e coverage.
- [ ] 5. Run typecheck, tests, build, lint, e2e, and Logics validation; record proof at closeout.
- [ ] ADR 009 checkpoint: update affected Logics docs during each meaningful wave and leave the repo commit-ready.
- [ ] Keep commit creation under operator control; do not force one commit per micro-step.
- [ ] GATE: do not close until lint, audit, and scaffold validation pass.

# Backlog
- `item_163_derive_non_winning_success_verdicts`
- `item_164_surface_non_winning_feedback_in_reports`

# Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] Generated request, product, backlog, and task docs are present.
- [ ] Context-pack handoff is available when requested.
- [ ] Validation passes.
- [ ] Meaningful waves followed ADR 009: affected docs updated and the repo left commit-ready without automatic commits.

# AC Traceability
- request-AC1 -> This task. Proof: scaffold command generated the request-chain corpus.
- request-AC4 -> This task. Proof: optional context-pack handoff is supported.
- request-AC6 -> This task. Proof: dry-run and collision checks bound file changes.
- request-AC8 -> This task. Proof: CLI help documents the one-pass scaffold workflow.

# Validation
- Run `python3 -m logics_manager lint --require-status`.
- Run scaffold command tests.

# Report
- Implementation complete.

# AI Context
- Summary: Orchestrate non-winning success feedback
