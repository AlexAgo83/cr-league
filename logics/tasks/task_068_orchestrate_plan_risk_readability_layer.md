# Context
- Orchestrate the scaffolded request chain and keep sibling implementation slices linked.

# Plan
- [ ] 1. Inspect current plan derivations, directive controls, send-plan confirmation, and report verdict helpers for reusable patterns.
- [ ] 2. Implement the smallest pure helper for safe/risky/high-upside derivation and focused tests.
- [ ] 3. Render the summary in PlanView and send-plan confirmation using existing compact panel styles.
- [ ] 4. Add i18n copy in EN/FR and targeted tests for render and flow behavior.
- [ ] 5. Run typecheck, tests, build, lint, e2e, and Logics validation; record proof at closeout.
- [ ] ADR 009 checkpoint: update affected Logics docs during each meaningful wave and leave the repo commit-ready.
- [ ] Keep commit creation under operator control; do not force one commit per micro-step.
- [ ] GATE: do not close until lint, audit, and scaffold validation pass.

# Backlog
- `item_161_derive_deterministic_plan_risk_reads`
- `item_162_render_plan_risk_summary_before_commitment`

# Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] Generated request, product, backlog, and task docs are present.
- [ ] Context-pack handoff is available when requested.
- [ ] Validation passes.
- [ ] Meaningful waves followed ADR 009: affected docs updated and the repo left commit-ready without automatic commits.

# AC Traceability
- request-AC1 -> This task. Proof: scaffold command generated the request-chain corpus.
- request-AC4 -> This task. Proof: optional context-pack handoff is supported.
- request-AC6 -> This task. Proof: dry-run and collision checks bound file changes.
- request-AC8 -> This task. Proof: CLI help documents the one-pass scaffold workflow.

# Validation
- Run `python3 -m logics_manager lint --require-status`.
- Run scaffold command tests.

# Report
- Implementation complete.

# AI Context
